## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hey, I'm Ushnika!

Welcome to my GitHub — where I break things, fix things,  
and learn things **one step at a time** (like a MERN monk in training).

---

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
Fixing bugs, polishing features, and building real-world MERN apps as a  
**MERN Intern at Quantinent AI**.  
Slowly leveling up from “what is this error?” → “ohh THAT’S why.”

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Next.js + TypeScript  
- Clean backend architecture  
- Writing code that Future-Me won’t hate  
- Debugging without crying (still in beta)

---

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
Fun MERN stack projects, clean UI builds,  
API-driven applications, or anything that challenges my brain—in a good way.

---

## 🤔 I’m looking for help with
- Scalable backend patterns  
- Understanding deep Node.js internals  
- Becoming the kind of developer who doesn’t panic when prod breaks 😄

---

## 💬 Ask me about
React • Node.js • MongoDB • Tailwind  
Internship survival strategies  
Why **console.log()** is my emotional support system

---

## 📫 How to reach me
📩 **Email:** karushnika@gmail.com  
Let’s connect, collaborate, or talk about cool ideas!

---

## ⚡ Fun fact
My code works perfectly…  
until someone says, *“Okay, show me.”*
